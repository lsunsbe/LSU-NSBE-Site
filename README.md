About
-----------
GeauxNSBE.org is the main homepage for LSU NSBE. This site is written from scratch in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. The site has a lot of server-side PHP code in some pages. The PHP is used to dynamically update the site at page creation time rather than requiring manual updates. 

Prerequisites
------------
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and PHP, as well as basic computer skills. 

How to Use

Conventions
---------------

INDEX
Each HTML file header contains the general tags (favicon,etc), followed by CSS linked files, fonts, general meta data, and social network data. The page also relies on multiple PHP code sections. The date section reads from upcomingevents.csv and constructs the appropriate table. The page also uses PHP to read all files in the images/frontpage directory and links them up. 

E-Board
Uses CSS animations for text animations and javascript and the display property manipulation to switch between biographies.
